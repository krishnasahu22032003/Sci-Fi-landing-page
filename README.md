# 🧠 NeuroSpark – Reactive Neural UI

NeuroSpark is a futuristic, perception-driven interface framework inspired by the fusion of **brain-computer interaction**, **visual cognition**, and **emotive design**. Built with **React**, **TailwindCSS**, and **GSAP**, it offers a fully responsive UI that reacts to user gaze, emotion, and motion — pioneering the future of intuitive digital interaction.
